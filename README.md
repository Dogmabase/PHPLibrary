# PHPLibrary
Library tool for personal use. This allows me to create my own library of code for reference


This project is very much unfinished, but it has basic functionality in place. I have yet to finish my database tasks, as
I had decided to move away from the SQLConnection style to EF.

My search function is not included yet either, as I am testing a few methods out on sample data.
